Readme for General_plate_reoncstruction

This folder contains a series of notebooks and associated metadata designed to perform basic analysis of plate reconstructions with pyGPlates.  Notebooks and examples include:

-altering gpml files
-converting plate IDs in gpml files and rotation files
-extracting lat/longs from subduction zones
-making virtual geomagnetic poles (VGP) for visualising palaeomagnetic data in GPlates
-making a time-space palaeomagnetic data plot
-plotting and visualising plate hierarchies

Some of these scripts are adapted from work done by Simon Williams (www.github.com/siwil22) and Michael Tetley (www.github.com/headmetal).
